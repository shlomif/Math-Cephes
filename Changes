      http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=25842
  - support for building on cygwin (patch supplied by Sisyphus)

    libmd library, which causes problems on some platforms:
      https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19716
  - don't run test 36 of t/poly.t, which seems to fail consistently
    on some platforms:

    and configure Makefile.PL to build static libmd.
  - generate a mconf.h for darwin (thanks to Thomas Puzia)
  - upgraded Cephes_wrap.c swig wrapper
  - prepended md_ prefix to many functions, to avoid

0.36    2002-09-12

  - added functions that require arrays into and out from
    C (simpson's rule, polynomial and matrix routines).
